### Fan Fact

1. 🎮 Fun Fact 1: I like playing Stardew Valley and optimizing my farm's layout!
2. 🧑‍💻 Fun Fact 2: My favorite language is Python

> Here's how I usually start a simple Python script:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Welcome to Chencheng's project!")
```


Let's build cool things together!
